Introduction
The BIBCO Standard Record (BSR) is a combination of RDA ?Core,? RDA ?Core if,? ?PCC Core,? and ?PCC Recommended? elements applicable to archival materials, audio recordings, cartographic resources, electronic resources (if cataloged in the computer file format), graphic materials, moving images, notated music, rare materials, and textual monographs. The BSR also incorporates supplemental requirements for these resource types when presented in digital formats, and it can be used to describe digital reproductions. Instructions in the BSR should be read in conjunction with the LC-PCC Policy Statements (LC-PCC PSs) that are integrated into the RDA Toolkit. When describing online resources, catalogers may also consult the PCC RDA Provider-Neutral guidelines. When describing continuing resources, catalogers should consult the CONSER Standard Record (CSR) RDA Metadata Application Profile.



The BSR follows RDA 0.6.4 in its approach to the concept of core: ?As a minimum, a resource description for a work, expression, manifestation, or item should include all the core elements that are applicable and readily ascertainable.? The ?PCC Recommended? elements are not core; their inclusion is encouraged but discretionary.



The BSR is a model for bibliographic monographic records using a single encoding level (Ldr/17=?blank?) in a shared database environment. Catalogers satisfy BSR requirements when creating and/or modifying bibliographic records, and determine the level of fullness that best suits the resources in their collections and the needs of their users. The BSR establishes a baseline set of elements that emphasize access points over descriptive data. The standard seeks to ensure inclusion of the essential data elements necessary to meet user needs; it is a solid "floor" description of a resource that can be built upon in a shared environment. The standard also does not preclude the use of any data in a bibliographic description representing more extensive cataloging treatment.



Authority records must support authorized access points in a BIBCO record. The mapping to MARC 21 fields included in the BSR is intended to be a general guide. For specific instructions on recording data in the MARC 21 format, please refer to official MARC 21 documentation, OCLC Bibliographic Formats and Standards, and the MARC-to-RDA/RDA-to-MARC mappings in the RDA Toolkit. BSR elements not directly related to RDA (e.g., classification; access points for subjects), or data treated in MARC 21 control/fixed fields, are included in separate tables at the end of this document.



Catalogers not authenticating their records for BIBCO may use the BSR for guidance but should also ensure that their records comply with any additional standards relevant to their particular situation where these vary from PCC requirements. In these records, some data required in BIBCO records will not be appropriate and should not be included (e.g., 008/39=?c? and 042=?pcc?). 



Timeframe for implementation of the BSR RDA Metadata Application Profile

The RDA Metadata Application Profile for the BSR was initially released for use by the PCC community in BIBCO-coded records on January 1, 2013, and was fully implemented two years later. As of January 1, 2015, all new BIBCO-coded records must follow the RDA Metadata Application Profile. The guidelines and requirements in the BSR have been revised periodically and will continue to evolve as the PCC evaluates their effectiveness, as modifications are made to Resource Description & Access, and as other RDA-related policies are developed within the PCC and other communities (e.g., development of various DCRM standards for rare materials). Any comments or suggestions for improving the BSR should be submitted to BIBCOmail@loc.gov.



Explanation of symbols in the ?RDA Instructions & Elements? column of the BSR table: 

* An asterisk (?*?) identifies a general instruction not limited to a particular bibliographic element. 

* A ?T? in parentheses identifies a transcribed element per RDA instructions (?take what you see?) or per LC-PCC Policy Statement (LC-PCC PS) for that instruction.

* A plus sign (?+?) identifies additional elements, beyond the RDA ?Core? and RDA ?Core if? elements, selected to be ?PCC Core? elements for the BIBCO program.

* An ?R? in parentheses identifies additional elements that, while not core in RDA or the BSR, the PCC recommends and encourages catalogers include when the element may be useful to support user tasks (find, identify, select, and obtain).

* The absence of a plus sign (?+?) and an (R) means RDA already defines the element as core.



Note: A core element in RDA will sometimes be associated with other core elements that represent special applications of the element for particular types of resources (e.g., 6.2.2 "Preferred Title for Work" is associated with 6.14.2 "Preferred Title for a Musical Work", 6.19.2 "Preferred Title for a Legal Work", etc.). In the BSR table, elements with this kind of relationship are grouped together in a single row for the sake of convenience.



Instructions for rare materials (books, cartographic resources, graphics, and notated music):

The rare materials provisions in the BSR are closely aligned with the provisions of Descriptive Cataloging of Rare Materials (DCRM) and may be used with any resources deemed rare by the cataloging agency. This includes resources that may require additional details of description to permit the ready identification of copies (e.g., as editions, impressions, or issues) and provide more exact descriptions of them as artifacts. Typically, resources produced before the advent of mechanized printing and papermaking processes in the early 19th century are more likely to require these additional details, but the BSR rare materials provisions may be used if necessary with resources from any period.



As is the case with the general provisions of the BSR, the rare materials provisions represent a floor on which other elements can be built. They are not intended to reproduce or replace DCRM, and elements in DCRM not in the BSR can certainly be included in the record. The BSR rare materials provisions generally call for expanded treatment of elements within the BSR or deem certain RDA elements to be core that are not considered core for other types of materials. Two cases call for different treatment rather than simply expansion of the description. These are: 1.7.1 alternative 1, which invokes the option of using DCRM as the designated published style manual in place of RDA 1.7.2-1.7.9 for transcribing; and 3.4, which calls for applying DCRM conventions when recording extent rather than RDA conventions. These were singled out by the rare community as areas where there were valid rare materials reasons for departing from the general guidelines.



It is intended that the rare materials provisions be usable with any format. However, one of the stipulations of applying the rare materials provisions is the recording of the appropriate ?dcrm? code in 040 in addition to ?rda? in order to label the record as following the BSR rare materials provisions. For the moment, the rare materials provisions in the RDA BSR, especially 1.7.1 alternative 1 and 3.4, should only be used with printed books, cartographic resources, graphics, and notated music (employing the codes ?dcrmb? for rare books, ?dcrmc? for rare cartographic resources, ?dcrmg? for rare graphics, and ?dcrmm? for rare notated music). As other DCRM modules (e.g., manuscripts) are published, the rare provisions of the BSR will become available to other formats and may be expanded. In the meantime other rare materials can certainly be cataloged using the BSR, including rare provisions that call for going beyond the floor of the general BSR, but they should be coded ?rda? only in 040 and should follow the general RDA guidelines for 1.7.1 and 3.4.



Note: Earlier iterations of the rare books BSR excluded resources produced before 1500. The rare materials provisions of the current BSR do not contain this exclusion and may be used with resources from any period.
